        <p class = "section-text">With nine years of musical experience and knowledge of several different styles, Vincent Perez is an experienced artist in his craft. </p>
        <p class = "section-text">Vincent’s musical journey began when he was around the age of 10. He began teaching himself how to play guitar, as it was an instrument nearly everyone in his family played. While he enjoyed playing guitar for many years, it wasn’t until he was 12 years old that he discovered the instrument he is most passionate about; cello. Vincent began playing cello through his middle school orchestra class, and quickly fell in love with the instrument.</p>
        <p class = "section-text">Seven years later, he has performed for internationally recognized artists and with talented colleagues from around the United States. “I never thought I would come this far”, he said, “with the support of my family and teachers, I was able to turn cello from a hobby into something I could do professionally”.  </p>
        <p class = "section-text">Recent accolades include attending the Sphinx Performance Academy at Curtis in 2019 and 2020, performing for Catalyst Quartet cellist Karlos Rodriguez and Dr.Mary Ann Ramos of Northern Arizona University, and earning a Division I rating at the Texas State Solo and Ensemble Competition. Vincent currently attends the Lamont School of Music at the University of Denver, and studies cello under Professor Matthew Zalkind. He is a grateful recipient of a Lamont Scholarship Award.</p>
